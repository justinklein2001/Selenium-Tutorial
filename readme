Required: Python3, pip, selenium framework

Purpose: I want to learn how to build bots to automate certain tasks, I found this tutorial online
that shows the purpose of Python's Selenium framework

Disclaimer: The code written follow's Tech With Tim's tutorials based off his website, with some functionality
no longer being supported, I still kept those sections so that I can look back at them when I build my own bots
for guidance
